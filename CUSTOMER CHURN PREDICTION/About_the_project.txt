Problem Statement :
CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION:

I have to Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. We will use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior
and customer demographics, and we will try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

Result :

This project was analyzed with three modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. Gradient Boosting emerged as the most accurate model, achieving an accuracy of 87.12%.
The findings provide actionable insights for reducing churn and improving customer retention strategies.
